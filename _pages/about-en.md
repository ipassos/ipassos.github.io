I am a Social Scientist who codes and a Statistician who thinks about society. My career is dedicated to using data to shed light on complex social justice and human rights issues.

Currently, I work as a Data Engineer, combining methodological rigor with software engineering to build scalable data pipelines (Big Data, NLP). I have robust experience handling sensitive data, having served as a quantitative researcher for the National Prison Census (CNJ) and in civil defense diagnostics (Cemaden/UNDP).

My hybrid background — holding a Master's in Sociology investigating algorithmic bias and currently pursuing a degree in Statistics — allows me to navigate between technical architecture and critical analysis, combining implementation skills with methodological and ethical rigor.

I am an open-source enthusiast and passionate about communities, serving as co-founder of R-Ladies Porto Alegre and organizer of AI Inclusive, promoting diversity and the democratization of Data Science.
